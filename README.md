# This is a little project of a responsive navbar 


### The challenge

Was to make it responsive in all screeens especially Small devices

### Screenshot

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

Started with html first and css second

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

* Start with Mobile-first, then desktop
* Best practises when doing navbar and what layouts to use 

`
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  media (max-width:748px) {
    .cont-nav{
        flex-direction: column;
    }
    header{
        text-align: center;
         margin: 1em 0; 
    }
    header h1{
        padding: .5em 0;
    }
    .sub-title{
        font-size: 1rem;
    }
    nav ul{
        flex-direction: column;
        
    }
    nav li {
        text-align: center;
        margin: .9em 0;
    }
}
}
```



### Continued development

Add Animation for the links when they're hovered
